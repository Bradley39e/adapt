Subject: Call for Implementations: WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module Candidate Recommendation


Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI announces publication of the Candidate Recommendation of:
              
	WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module
	https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt-symbols/

Background:

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) symbols are alternative ways of writing. Some people with disabilities do better when AAC symbols are used instead of (or in addition to)standard on-screen text. The purpose of this specification is to support Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) symbols in web content. 

Millions of users comprehend AAC symbols better than standard text, but there are multiple AAC symbol sets and they are not mutually comprehensible. To solve this issue and make it possible for content creators to support AAC users in web content. This specification defines the appropriate use of Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI) concept indexing as spefieid by the W3C Alternative and Augmented Communication (AAC) Symbol Registry [1] in web content.

Authors are provided guidance on associating an appropriate BCI index value with a span of text corresponding to the defined concept expressed as standard text.

It is anticipated that user agents will display the corresponding AAC symbol from the user's preferred symbol set by allowing the user to configure for their preferred AAC symbol set and cache that symbol set locally.

Implementations and Comments:

*15 June 2023* is the deadline for implementations. We welcome implementations for symbol attribute in websites and web apps. To comment, please use one of the following two methods:
