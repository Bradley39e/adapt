Subject: Call for Implementations: 'WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module' Candidate Recommendation

Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI invites implementations of the 'Candidate Recommendation':
	WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module
	https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt-symbols/
	
WAI-Adapt specifications are introduced in:
	WAI-Adapt Overview
	https://www.w3.org/WAI/adapt/

Background: Symbols are visual representations of words and ideas. Symbol-based communication is used by people who cannot read or process text well, and can understand symbols better. Symbols are used in many alternative and augmented communication (AAC) systems for people who do not speak. The user selects symbols and the AAC device speaks the words. Symbols are also used for people to get information, including people who can speak. For example, a person who cannot read has a list of tasks as a series of symbols.

The purpose of the WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module specification is to support symbols in web content. It enables authors to add semantic information about content at the element level. Then user tools can display the corresponding symbol from the user's preferred symbol set.

Candidate Recommendation:
The main purpose of Candidate Recommendation is to ensure that the standard can be implemented. More about Candidate Recommendation and the process for completing standards is in:

Implementations and Comments:
We welcome implementations of the symbol attribute in websites and web apps. To provide information about implementations or to comment, please use GitHub or e-mail:
* GitHub: Please open a new issue in the WAI-Adapt GitHub repository
	https://github.com/w3c/adapt/issues/new
* E-mail: Please send comments as text in a message (not an attachment) to <public-adapt@w3.org>
Please create separate GitHub issues or e-mail messages for each topic, rather than commenting on multiple topics in a single issue or message.

Please send comments by Friday 24 February 2023.
Please send information on implementations by 15 June 2023.
