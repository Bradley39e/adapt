Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI invites implementations of the 'Candidate Recommendation':
	WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module
	https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt-symbols/
	
WAI-Adapt is introduced in:
	WAI-Adapt Overview
	https://www.w3.org/WAI/adapt/

option 1@@ Background: Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) symbols are alternative ways of writing. Some people with disabilities communicate better with AAC symbols instead of standard text, or with symbols in addition to text.

option 2@@ Background: Symbols are visual representations of words and ideas. Symbol-based communication is used by some people who cannot communicate using speech alone, and who have low literacy with text and better fluency with symbols. Symbols are used in many alternative and augmented communication (AAC) systems. For example, the user selects symbols and the AAC device speaks the words.

The purpose of this specification is to support AAC symbols in web content. It enables authors to add semantic information about content at the element level. Then user tools can display the corresponding AAC symbol from the user's preferred symbol set.

[@@ is this useful here, or unecessary complexity here?] This specification references the W3C Alternative and Augmented Communication (AAC) Symbol Registry, which provides an extensible registry for the Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI) concept index. It provides a mapping between concepts expressed in standard text and corresponding symbols in major AAC symbol sets in use today.

Candidate Recommendation:
The main purpose of Candidate Recommendation is to ensure that the standard can be implemented. More about Candidate Recommendation and the process for completing standards is in:

Implementations and Comments:

*15 June 2023* is the deadline for implementations. We welcome implementations for symbol attribute in websites and web apps. To provide information about implementations or to comment, please use GitHub or e-mail:

* GitHub: Please open a new issue in the WAI-Adapt GitHub repository
	https://github.com/w3c/adapt/issues/new

* E-mail: Please send comments as text in a message (not an attachment) to <public-adapt@w3.org>

Please create separate GitHub issues or e-mail messages for each topic, rather than commenting on multiple topics in a single issue or message.

Please send comments by Friday 24 February 2023.
