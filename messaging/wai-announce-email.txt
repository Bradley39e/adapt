Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI announces publication of the Candidate Recommendation of:
              
WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module

https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt-symbols/

*** Overview ***

* For the very first time in web content the WAI-Adapt: Symbols Module specifies a cross-platform standrad mechanism incorporating Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) symbols in web content. It relies on the [W3C Alternative and Augmented Communication (AAC) Symbol Registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/aac-registry/) to achieve this. 

* Authors are provided guidance on associating an appropriate BCI index value with a span of text corresponding to the defined concept expressed as standard text.

* It is anticipated that user agents will display the corresponding AAC symbol from the user's preferred symbol set by allowing the user to configure for their preferred AAC symbol set and cache that symbol set locally.

For in-progress updates to the document, see the Editors' Draft at:
