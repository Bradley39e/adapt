		                        <p>This specification provides web content authors a standard approach to support web users who are persons with various cognitive and learning disabilities, including users who:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Customarily communicate using symbolic languages generally known as Augmentative and Alternative Communications (<abbr title="Augmentative and Alternative Communication">AAC</abbr>);</li>
						<li>Need more familiar icons (and other graphical symbols) in order to comprehend page content;</li>
						<li>Benefit from additional help resources;</li>
						<li>Require a simplified page in order to interact successfully.</li>
					</ul>

							<p>The technology described in this specification is intended to be used to programmatically transform the appearance of typical web content including form controls, icons, and other user interface elements	into a rendering more familiar and comprehensible to an individual user. Providing additional help is supported, as is automated page simplification. Use cases and relevant vocabulary terms are defined which allow user agents to augment or adapt content to better fit a particular user's particular needs. This helps users with varying needs to understand web content more readily, by
					simplifying the web interaction, and by avoiding forcing the user to grapple with unfamiliar representations they are ill equipped to comprehend.</p>
					                        <p>This Personalization Semantics Content Module 1.0 is a component of the Personalization Semantics series introduced in the <a href="../">Personalization Semantics Explainer 1.0</a> document [[personalization-semantics-1.0]].</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>This specification module enables authors to add semantic information about content at the element level, in order to facilitate a more familiar or comprehensible interface for the individual user. Multiple screen renderings (transformations) are supported in order to meet the differing needs of different users. Final renderings &mdash; generated via helper apps or 3rd-party tools &mdash; are ultimately defined by the user's configuration settings.</p>
				
				<p>The goal of the attributes and values described in this specification is to enable personalized communication and web content interaction for the individual user. This specification includes facilities to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Transform the user interface (UI) through the addition, removal, or adaptation of content which otherwise tends to have a negative impact on Augmentative and Alternative Communications (<abbr title="Augmentative and Alternative Communication">AAC</abbr>) users;</li>
					<li>Provide extra support to the user;</li>
					<li>Enable new adapted user agents for people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Personalization Semantics is a series of technical specifications that provide the element-level attributes and values which enable user agents and helper-applications to adapt content to an individual user's needs. It relies on author-supplied page and element level metadata in order to achieve individualized personalization.</p>

				<p>Personalization Semantics currently consists of three modules: Content, Help, and Support Tools. The specification defined in this document is the Personalization Semantics Content Module&mdash;the first of the Personalization Semantics Modules series.</p>

				<p>Personalization Semantics is more fully introduced in our <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-1.0/">Personalization Semantics Explainer</a> [[personalization-semantics-1.0]].</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Personalization Semantics Content Module</h2>
				<p>Personalization Semantics Content Module is the first part of the Personalization Semantics technical specification, which provides personalization semantics and vocabularies that can be used to mark-up web content with additional semantic information, enabling user agents to augment or adapt content to various user-scenarios based on the user’s personalization settings or preferences. The Content Module enhances web content by providing additional information about form controls, buttons, links, and other user interface elements. User agents use these semantics to augment or adapt content to the user’s scenario &mdash; for example allowing for the conversion of text to symbols. This helps users with varying needs to understand the content by providing support for simplification and/or a way to manage unnecessary distractions.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Vocabulary Structure and Implementations</h2>
				<p>All the vocabulary in Personalization Semantics Content Module is constructed of properties and their values. Please see our <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-1.0/">Personalization Semantics Explainer</a>. </p>
				<p>The vocabulary implementations included in this document are available at our <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Implementations-of-Semantics">implementations wiki page</a>.</p>
				 <div class="ednote">Since implementations have not yet been finalized, any examples in this document are illustrative only, and are provided to help in understanding the concept.  All examples will be updated once implementation examples are finalized.</div>

              <p>Sometimes called "age related memory loss"</p>
              <p>People with age appropriate forgetfulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging. They may take longer to learn new things, forget something but remember it later, or occasionally forget particular words. (This differs from dementia where forgetfulness is due to a  disorder and is more pronounced.)</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Alternative and Augmentative Communication System</dt>
        <dd>
              <p>Sometimes referred to as "AAC"</p>
              <p>Any method, device or application that can be used to help those who cannot use spoken language and need additional support by means of symbols, images and/or text.

          <dt>Anxiety Disorders</dt>
        <dd>
              <p>People who have anxiety disorders struggle with intense and uncontrollable feelings of anxiety, fear, worry, and/or panic. This is more than just feeling worried once in a while. This may last for a long time and can interfere with daily activities, such as concentration and executive functioning.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Attention Deficit (hyperactivity) disorder, AD(H)D</dt>
        <dd>
              <p>Sometimes called Attention deficit disorder, ADD, and Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD</p>
              <p>Attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder or AD(H)D involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted.

              <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by some degree of impaired social behavior, communication and language abilities. This may also impact the person’s ability to regulate behavior and attention. Individuals can have a narrow range of interests and activities and they may rely on alternative communication methods. Some individuals may also experience episodes of sensory overload. See neurodiversity for an alternative approach to ASD and other cognitive disabilities.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Brain Injury</dt>
          <dd>
              <p>Brain injury including Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Acquired Brain Injury (ABI),  are caused by damage to the brain which can lead to long-term impairment of  executive function, memory, learning, coordination, speech and emotions as well as other physical and sensory impairments.</p>
              <p>Brain injury can have many different causes such as a concussion or stroke, and can happen at any stage of life.</p>

          <dd>
              <p>May include: Cognitive Disabilities, Learning Disabilities (LD), Intellectual Disabilities  and Specific Learning Disability</p>
              <p>Cognitive disabilities and learning disabilities can mean different things in different locations. Taken together they refer to: </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Significantly reduced ability in one or more areas of cognitive function that affect learning, such as communication, reading, writing or math. Note overall intelligence is often not affected and people may function any level in other areas of learning.  (Sometimes known as learning disability or specific learning disability) and / or</li>
                  <li>Significantly reduced ability to understand new or complex information and learn new skills, with a reduced ability to cope independently. (Sometimes known as cognitive disability, learning disability or intellectual disability) and / or
                  <li>Significantly reduced memory and attention or visual, verbal or numerical thinking</li>
              </ul>
          </dd>
          <dt>Early Stage Dementia</dt>
          <dd>
              <p>Common impairments of early stage dementia include memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word. These may appear before a diagnosis of dementia. At this stage, these symptoms are often mild.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Easy To Understand Language</dt>
          <dd>
          <p>May include: Easy Reading, Easy To Read, Plain Language, Easy To Understand.</p>
              <p>Easy To Understand Language refers to text content that is in an accessible, easy to understand, form. It is often useful for people with learning disabilities, and is easier for many other people as well. </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Executive Function</dt>
          <dd>
              <p>The group of cognitive processes and skills required for planning,  fulfilling tasks and goals. It includes working memory and remembering details, impulse inhibition, organizing tasks, managing time, fluid reasoning and solving problems.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Memory impairments</dt>
          <dd>
              <p>Memory impairments refer to an inability to recognize or recall pieces of information or skills that are usually remembered. It can affect:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Working memory that holds information while it is processed. For example, we rely on working memory for tasks such as copying a number. </li>
                  <li>Short-term Memory that stores information for a short time before it is stored in long-term memory. For example, we may rely on short-term memory to remember the location of menus items between web pages</li>
                  <li>Long-term Memory that holds information long term, such as information from personal events, language and information. For example, we may rely on long-term memory to recall past events.</li>
              </ul>
          </dd>
          <dt>Mental health</dt>
          <dd>
              <p>Includes: Mental health impairment</p>
              <p>Mental health refers to our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. A mental health impairment/condition generally has some combination of disturbed thoughts, emotions and ability to relate to others that impairs daily functioning. Examples include depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. These conditions may cause temporary or long term  issues with accessing information, such as difficulty focusing on information, processing information, or understanding it.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)</dt>
          <dd>
              <p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can involve problems with memory, language, thinking and judgment that are greater than normal age-related challenges. It is sometimes considered the stage between the common and expected age appropriate forgetfulness  and the more serious decline of dementia although many or most people with MCI will not develop dementia.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Neurodiversity</dt>
          <dd>
              <p>Neurodiversity is a term that refers to the different ways the brain can work and interpret information. It highlights that people naturally think about things differently. Autistic people, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD(H)D), Dyslexia, and other diagnoses or labels may prefer the term “neurodiverse” as they are part of normal and healthy variation in the human population, bringing diverse skills and perspectives.</p>
          </dd>
      </dl>





<div class="ednote">We intend to incorporate additional terms from the glossary from the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force, when it is ready. If there are non-editorial differences, we will use the term definitions above.
