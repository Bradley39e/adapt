			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>Background on Personalization Semantics</h2>
				<p>This specification is designed to enable authors to add extra semantic information about content to enable personalization for the individual user, including providing extra support and enabling user agents for people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</p>
				<p>The goal of these attributes and values is to enable personalization for the individual user, including providing extra support, transforming the user interface (UI) through the addition, removal, or adaptation of content that has a negative impact on the primary user-group, and enabling new user agents for people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</p>
				
				<p>Personalization semantics is a series of technical specifications that provide the element-level attributes and values enable user agents and helper-applications to adapt the content for the individual needs of the user. Rather than developing complex solutions for a wide range of users, 
	
authors can add personalization semantics, so that the content can be personalized to the needs of each user. They aim to  provide more optimal accessibility, including providing extra support, transforming the user interface (UI) through the addition, removal, or adaptation of content that has a negative impact on the primary user-group, and enabling new user agents for people with learning and cognitive disabilities. </p>
				<p>Personalization semantic consists of three modules, they are Content, Help and Support, Tools. This Personalization Semantics Content Module specification is one of personalization semantics modules.</p>

				<p>Personalization semantics are fully introduced in  our <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Explainer-for-Personalization-Semantics">Explainer for Personalization Wiki</a> and [[personalization-semantics-1.0]].</p>

				<h2>Personalization Semantics Content Module</h2>
				<p>Personalization Semantics Content Module is one of Personalization semantics technical specification, which provides personalization semantics and vocabularies that can be used to annotate web content enabling user agents to augment or adapt content to various user scenarios based on the user’s personalization settings or preferences. The Content Module enhance web content by providing information about form controls, symbols, and other user interface elements. User agents use the semantics to augment or adapt content to the user’s scenario. This helps users with varying needs to understand the content by providing support for simplification and a way to manage unnecessary distractions.</p>

				<h2>Vocabulary Structure and Implementations</h2>
				<p>All the vocabulary in Personalization Semantics Content Module are made of properties and their values. Please see our  our <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Explainer-for-Personalization-Semantics">Explainer for Personalization Wiki</a>. </p>
				<p>The vocabulary implementations included in this document are available at our <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Implementations-of-Semantics">implementations wiki page</a>.</p>

				<h2>Use Cases and Requirements</h2>
				<p>The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Requirements">Requirements for Personalization Semantics</a> describes use cases and requirements. This module provides properties to fulfill requirements related to adaptable content.</p>

			<h1>Terms</h1>
			<<dl>

  <dt>Age Appropriate Forgetfulness (sometimes called “age related memory loss”)</dt>

  <dd>


People with age appropriate forgetfulness have impaired memory issues that can be a normal part of healthy aging. They may take longer to learn new things, forget something but remember it later, or occasionally forget particular words. (This differs from dementia where forgetfulness is due to a  disorder and is more pronounced.)


</dd>

  <dt>Alternative and Augmentative Communication System (sometimes referred to as “AAC”)</dt>

  <dd>


Any method, device or app that can be used to help those who cannot use spoken language and need additional support by means of symbols, images and/or text. For example a screen with symbols that the user can select to speak the appropriate words or add them to a document.


</dd>

</dl>





<div class="ednote">We intend to incorporate additional terms from the glossary from the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force, when it is ready. If there are non editorial differences, we will use the term definition above.

 See <a href="https://raw.githack.com/w3c/coga/Glossary-draft/glossary/index.html">COGA Glossary</a>.</div>

			<h1>Privacy and Security Considerations</h1>
						<p>This specification adds context information about content to the document should not affect security.</p>

			<p>Although this specification does not expose personal preferences and personal information,

third party user agent or proxy server acting upon our semantic information may need to store personal preferences on how to  present content to a specific user. We recommend any user agent or proxy server implements best practices to protect all personal preferences and personal information.</p>
		
<p>Any user agent with user setting are recommended to follow best practices to keep user information secure.</p>
		<p>The Privacy and Security Considerations of Personalization Semantics Content Module is also discussed at <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/issues/131">issue #131</a>.</p>
