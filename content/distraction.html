		<h3>Description</h3>
		<div class="property-description">
            <p>The <code>distraction</code> attribute is intended to be used on non-essential distracting content, so that people who have problems keeping focus can minimize or turn the content off. An example user experiences would be to hide all non-essential distracting content.</p>
			<p>Note that there is no default value.</p>
			<p>Note that elements with the <code>distraction</code> attribute should also have a label or accessible name.</p>
			
			<p>It has been noted that advertising constitutes the critical revenue stream for many content providers. The purpose of allowing users to hide (or systematically show and sequentially review) on page advertising is simply to give distracted users the same control others have over such content. The user without a disability can ignore the advertisement and complete the task. The user who cannot ignore it, or TAB past it conveniently, is forced to grapple with a stumbling block that prevents them from completing a task.</p>
			<p>Users will choose to look at advertising because it's informative. It's an important mechanism for learning about options in life. By allowing users to control when and how they see ads, they have the ability to avoid becoming frustrated by processes that prevent task completion. This allows them to see advertising as potentially useful information, not a source of frustration. The alternative is that a frustrated user will not follow up on the ad that caused the frustration.</p>
