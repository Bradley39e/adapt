		<h3>Description</h3>
		<div class="property-description">
							<p>The <code>simplification</code> attribute differentiates between critical features and less important features for simplification.</p>
							<p>This allows simplified interfaces with less options or interfaces that emphasize critical features. Adaptations can be based on personalization settings. </p>
						

							 <p class="ednote">This was formerly <code>importance</code>. However different people may feel that sections that would be hidden in a simplified version are still very important, such as marketing content or legal terms.)</p>

							<div class="note">
								<p>These semantics aid simplification. But what content is most useful to a user varies from user to user. For example, men may be more interested in men's clothing, and may not be interested in the more frequently use women's clothing option. For that reason we may add context for elements that will help the personalization agent select the most useful content for a given user (see the <a href="#context">context</a> attribute). This is also necessary for reminders (see below).</p>
								<p>It is worth mentioning that a lot of this information is known for personalization of advertisements and content optimization. </p>
